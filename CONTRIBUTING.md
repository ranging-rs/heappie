# Presentation anchors in inline comments
Sections of source files are loaded by
https://peter-kehl.github.io/embedded_low_level_rust. Instead of line numbers,
that presentation refers to parts of the source files by strings that are
present in the code in inline comments. Those comments serve as delimiters of
code sections to present. So please leave in any Rust comments `//` or /*...*/
or `Cargo.toml` comments `#` containing `presentation-`.
